# Web-chat-app
This project is a real messaging app that developed with pure javascript without third-party libs. We focused on the Web Components in this project and give it a real component structure. All chats, messages, data are fake and generated with a data-factory. I hope It would be useful. Special topics covered:Web Components,Object-Oriented Programming,Event handling,DOM controlling,CSS flex.
